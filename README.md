Interviewing a designer - a checklist...
========================================

Before the interview, have a look at their portfolio and choose an interesting project (we'll use this later).

- Do you like their visual design?
- Is it modern, and relevant for the subject matter?
- Does it have good information heirachy?
- At a first glance, can you quickly understand what you're meant to do?
- Is the copy they've chosen clear and concise?

# A bit of background

Ask them to tell you about their background - this will ease in the interview before we get to the hard questions.

- Where did you learn design? Why did you choose design?
- Do you consider yourself a designer or programmer?
- What type of design do you find most challenging? 
- What skill would you like to improve the most?

# Process

Remember we chose an interesting project from their portfolio? Make sure you're familiar with it, and then ask them some open ended questions to understand how they approached this project:

- What problem were you given to solve?
- How did you approach solving it?
- How many concepts did you try?
- Who do you bounce ideas off?

# The design exercise

Lastly, have an exercise prepared to run through together. This will let you see how they approach new projects. By now you should have a fairly decent idea of what his/her weakness could be - so pick an exercise that capitilizes on that. For example, if their portfolio is mainly great visual design of static web pages, ask them to design the interface for a mobile app.

During the exercise, look for the following things, a sign of a good designer:

- A lot of questions early on to get the full picture
- A bullet pointed list of features (functional spec, or "what the design needs to solve")
- Clear understanding of basic design principles
- Clear understanding of design paradigms for the platform chosen (ie, mobile, desktop, etc)
- Discussion about how the exercise can spin off into a product, cool new features to add, that sort of thing

## Example exercises

Here are some example exercises I've come up with that might help:

1. A challenging user sign up flow (interaction design)

We're building a furniture recommendation web app where we need to know the users favourite color before they actually get to the main application. During the sign up flow, how can we help the user find their favourite colour?

Good things to look for:

- Many people won't know what their favourite colour is, does the designer try to create a small game or challenge for the user to help them narrow down their choice?
- Is the solution short enough to still be part of the sign up flow? Remember there will be extra steps that the user needs to complete before or after this step.
- Does the designer suggest further interesting ideas for the furniture recommendation service? Do they exploit this by including furniture in the colour picking step?


2. A mobile application for cruise ship crew management (mobile design)

Ask the designer to sketch out a few screens for a mobile app you're thinking of building. Cruise ships have crews of hundreds and can be away from port for days at a time. Ask the designer to flesh out some wireframes for an application that can:

- Provide a list of all passengers for the crew member to look up
- Allow the crew member to mark passengers as special (ie, VIP, or causing trouble)
- Show some statistics about the ship, such as when it'll dock next, the weight, speed it's traveling, etc.

Good things to look for:

- Do they group things in an intelligent and obvious way?


3. A guitar tuner with only one button (product design with a constraint)
